   <h2>Why nonexpert? &#129300</h2>
   <p>Well, I haven't read canon books or watched 
    all seasons of clone wars, so these reviews come only from watching the movies and the new series, so I'm sorry to all those Star Wars gatekeeper fans out there &#128517 &#9996</p>
   <p>Without furder ado...let's dive in:</p>

         <h2>Episode I</h2>
         <p>
         I think is important to mention that I was 8 years old when this movie was released, so as a kid I thought this movie
         was amazing, I was used to the old special effects from the original trilogy so naturally when I saw the, back then, new special
         effects my mind was blown &#129327 I really didn't care how annoying Jar Jar Binks character was. My favorite part of the movie
         is definitely the duel of Qui Gon and Obi-Wan vs Darth Maul (I mean, the dude just takes out a double lightsaber!), the fight scenes, the score, it was fantastic, that's when I learned how
         much of a badass Obi-Wan truly is.

         <h2>Episode II</h2>
         <p>
         Now we get to see Anakin Skywalker in full jedi mode (more like padawan mode but whatever) and like every other teenager, he's full of cockiness, rage and driven by his hormones. Of course Palpatine suggests him to be in charge of Padme's safety (I see what you did there, Palpatine &#128527)
         and this is where we get a glimpse of future Darth Vader when the sand people not only kidnaps but also tortures and kills Anakin's mom. To say he gets his revenge would be an understatement. Experts say that the voice we hear when Anakin is annihilating the whole village is Qui-Gon's telling him to stop. 
         I mean, I get he was upset but he said he also killed the children and that's where I draw the line &#128517 . In this movie they also introduce Jango Fett and his famous clones which are supposed to be the Republic's army to give the Jedi a break (later we find out that's not the case. Again, well played Palpatine, well played) and Count Dooku,
         Qui-Gon's old master, and not only did he kicked Obi-Wan and Anakin's butt (chopping Anakin's hand in the process) he also fights Master Yoda in the end. A badass sith lord if you ask me. Moreover, this is the first time we see a bunch of jedi knights in action. Seeing all those different lightsabers vs the blast guns from droids was spectacular, also, Master Windu's (Samuel L. Jackson) purple lightsaber steals the show.

         <h2>Episode III</h2>
         <p>
         This is my favorite movie of them all. We see Anakin's turn to the dark side and the Jedi's demise. You are hooked from the beginning when Obi-Wan and Anakin are rescuing Palpatine from Count Dooku. Anakin is not a padawan anymore and he's more skilled and powerful, finally able to defeat (and kill, ignoring the Jedi code) Count Dooku. Still, the Jedi don't trust him and doesn't give him the rank of master that he thinks he deserves. That's one of the several strikes the Jedi make, pushing Anakin to seek Palpatine's support. We find out Padme is pregnant, but the problem is that Anakin starts having these "prophetic" dreams about her dying during childbirth, so he starts
         losing it and trying to make everything he can to prevent it (can't really blame him on that one). He then finds out Palpatine is the sith lord causing all the trouble, and warns Master Windu about it. And what do the Jedi decide to do? NOT TRUST Anakin again (seriously Jedi order, you kind of did this to yourselves) and went ahead and faced Palpatine. Of course Palpatine kills everyone except Master Windu, 
         and when he finally was about to be defeated by him, Anakin comes in, asks Windu not to kill him because he needs to gain some knowledge from him about how to prevent Padme from dying. Master Windu ignores him (like he usually does) and just when he's going to finish Palpatine off, Anakin chops Windu's hand and Palpatine throws him out of the window with his electric ray powers &#9889. 
         Grateful with Anakin for saving his life, he then appoints him as the newest sith lord and gives him the famous Darth Vader name. Anakin and the clones proceed to execute the hearbreaking order 66 &#128148 which consists of killing all Jedis. Execution of order 66 scene is one of the saddest scenes in the series, if not the saddest I dare say. The music, the killing of jedi knights all ages, is truly heartbreaking. After all of this, Obi-Wan tells Padme what Anakin did, she couldn't believe it and goes
         to face Anakin. He dismisses everything and later finds Obi-Wan standing at Padme's spaceship door (I don't know the term for that so I'll just stick with door &#129315 ). Now we see one of the best fight scenes ever, is Obi-wan vs Anakin, master vs apprentice,
         showing off their skills until Obi-Wan reaches the high ground warning Anakin to not even try it, but of course he does and Obi-Wan ends up chopping Anakin's hand and legs (seriously, what's with all this limb chopping in this universe? is that their way of telling us how dangerous a lightsaber is? I think we got it from the first movie when that happened, when Darth Vader chops Luke's hand). He then cries, because of course it hurts him to see his student/friend/bro all turned into the dark side and well, burning alive too. He leaves to take care of Padme who then gives birth to Luke and Leia.
         Palpatine rescues Anakin, they treat his wounds and we finally see the rise of Lord Vader and his famous mask! *Nice*. Back to Obi-Wan and Yoda, they decide to separate Luke and Leia so the empire can't find them, Leia goes with senator Organa to Alderaan and Luke goes with Obi-Wan to Luke's family in Tatooine (Yoda decides he's not a babysitter and goes to Dagoba to live his best life just chilling).
